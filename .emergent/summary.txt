<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully enhanced a media monitoring application, building upon its initial MVP state. The trajectory showcases a progression through significant feature additions and critical production readiness efforts. Initially, the focus was on refining UI/UX for a professional look, implementing a sophisticated GPT-based sentiment analysis with asynchronous processing and population reaction prediction, and addressing pending features like article filtering and visual analytics. A major challenge involved resolving persistent production deployment failures, primarily related to phantom  dependencies and other heavy packages, which required deep debugging and environment cleanup. The work concluded with the implementation of UI animations, color enhancements, and an attempt to integrate source logos into article displays, highlighting a robust iterative development approach and problem-solving capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive media monitoring platform for Guadeloupe, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Its core purpose is to provide daily articles from local news sites, automated radio transcription via OpenAI Whisper API, intelligent summarization, 24-hour caching, and a daily news digest. It also includes social media monitoring (X and Facebook) with local sentiment analysis and a search bar, all presented through a responsive frontend.

Key enhancements and new functionalities include:
*   **AI-driven Analysis**: Utilizing GPT-4.1-mini/GPT-4o-mini for transcriptions and sentiment analysis, with detailed transcription status and radio content prioritization.
*   **Data Capture & Management**: Robust segmented capture for long radio streams, hourly article scraping, and daily cache invalidation.
*   **Social Media Integration**: Fixed and improved data extraction using reliable methods (Twitter API v2, Nitter, RSS feeds).
*   **Alerting**: Automated Telegram alerts for keyword mentions and task status.
*   **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Transition from local to precise, GPT-based sentiment analysis with enriched, asynchronous output and population reaction prediction.
*   **Deployment Readiness**: Removal of heavy local AI dependencies (spaCy, local Whisper) to ensure smoother production deployment.
*   **UI/UX Overhaul**: Transformation to a responsive, minimalist, and professional design, incorporating premium fonts, structured article blocks, and replacement of emojis with professional indicators.
*   **New Features**: Implementation of article filters and sorting, visual analytics/dashboards, and improved mobile UX (hamburger menu, touch navigation).
*   **Aesthetic Enhancements**: Strengthening sub-colors for better visual appeal and attempting to integrate source logos into article displays.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer has identified several missing critical functionalities that were not implemented in this trajectory, pending user confirmation:
-   Implement a system for **pagination** or infinite scroll for articles.
-   Add a **footer** with essential information.
-   Improve **loading states** with more sophisticated skeletons.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two primary user requests: renforc√© la sous couleur (strengthen sub-colors) and r√©cup le logo des site dont ils sont issus (retrieve source logos for articles).

For **color reinforcement**, the AI engineer successfully updated the CSS variables in , adding new, more vibrant colors for various elements and specific brand colors for sources like La Premi√®re and KaribInfo. This enhanced the visual appeal and contrast of the application.

For **source logo integration**, the AI engineer began by creating a  utility function in  to map source names to their respective logos or fallbacks. This function was integrated into the article display logic within  for filtered articles and other sections. New CSS styles were also added to  to optimize the display of these logos. However, upon testing, the user reported, je ne vois pas le logo sur les article. The AI engineer acknowledged this, identifying the likely cause as inaccessible logo URLs, and planned to fix it by using favicon APIs or creating stylized CSS logos, and ensuring logo display across all relevant article sections.

Prior to these, the engineer successfully implemented:
-   **Article Filtering and Sorting**: New backend endpoints and frontend UI for advanced article filtering (by source, date, etc.).
-   **Visual Analytics Dashboard**: New backend endpoints for aggregate data and frontend integration of Chart.js for visual representation of sentiment over time, source distribution, and keyword sentiment.
-   **Mobile UX Improvements**: Implementation of a responsive hamburger menu and tactile navigation within  and corresponding styles in .
-   **UI Animations**: Added various CSS animations (, , etc.) and a JavaScript  for scroll-triggered animations across the header, navigation, dashboard, and article sections, creating a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
-   **Deployment Fixes**: A significant effort was made to debug and resolve production deployment failures, which stemmed from phantom  dependencies and other heavy packages. This involved extensive dependency cleaning, creating , , , , and  to ensure a clean and robust production build process.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to fix the issue where source logos are not appearing on articles, specifically by re-evaluating the logo fetching method and ensuring all article display sections incorporate the logo logic correctly.
