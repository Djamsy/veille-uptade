<analysis>
The AI engineer has built a robust media monitoring application from the ground up, successfully transitioning it into a specialized tool for Guadeloupe-specific news and social media. The development trajectory demonstrates a strong focus on iterative problem-solving and adaptability to evolving user requirements. Initial efforts centered on establishing core functionalities like web scraping, speech-to-text transcription, and a basic caching mechanism.

Significant challenges included meticulously debugging and refining web scrapers for diverse website structures (France-Antilles, RCI, La 1ère, KaribInfo) and resolving persistent Collection objects do not implement truth value errors within the MongoDB integration and caching logic. The engineer implemented local sentiment analysis using Python libraries (VADER, TextBlob, spaCy) to avoid external API dependencies, extending it to analyze both articles and a newly introduced daily digest. Most recently, a social media scraping and sentiment analysis module was integrated for X (Twitter) and Facebook, pragmatically using demo data when live scraping faced technical hurdles. The current phase involves frontend enhancements, specifically integrating a search bar and a comments page, alongside backend support for these features.

<product_requirements>
The application is a media monitoring interface initially designed for general online feeds, speech-to-text, article listing, and social media sentiment analysis, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It evolved into a specialized system for Guadeloupe, requiring:

-   **Automated Article Listing:** Daily scraping (10 AM) from , , , and . Articles should display Title with hyperlinks.
-   **Automated Radio Transcription:** Capture and local transcription (Whisper) of  (7:00 AM - 7:20 AM) and  (7:00 AM - 7:30 AM).
-   **Intelligent Summarization:** Each article/transcription point summarized as Title + short explanation.
-   **Intelligent Caching:** 24-hour cache for articles to prevent infinite loading and improve performance. Cache must clear on update.
-   **Local Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis without external APIs for articles, radio transcriptions, and social media posts.
-   **Daily Digest:** A daily summary of articles/transcriptions, now enhanced with sentiment analysis and professional design.
-   **Social Media Monitoring:** Retrieve comments/posts from X (Twitter) and Facebook based on keywords, with local sentiment analysis. Specific targeting for Conseil Départemental de la Guadeloupe and Guy Losbar.
-   **Frontend Enhancements:** Add a search bar to the dashboard and create a dedicated comments page.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack setup: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application, handling all backend API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Initially set up for various functionalities. Extensively modified to fix MongoDB truth value errors, implement today-only article filtering, integrate cache invalidation, and add new endpoints for local sentiment analysis, daily digest creation/retrieval, social media scraping, social media sentiment analysis, and a general search endpoint. It now also directly retrieves articles/transcriptions for the digest from MongoDB.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages web scraping from Guadeloupean news sites.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to create specialized scraping functions (, , , ) for each source due to unique HTML structures.  and site-specific selectors were refined to accurately capture articles and handle relative URLs.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Implements an intelligent caching layer for articles and other data.
    -   **Changes**: Created for caching. Debugged multiple times to resolve Collection objects do not implement truth value testing errors by changing  to . Integrated with  and configured for 24-hour refresh, with cache invalidation on new scrapes.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created file for local, API-free sentiment analysis.
    -   **Changes**: Implements sentiment scoring using VADER, TextBlob, and  with extended French dictionaries, emoji handling, and Guadeloupe-specific patterns (e.g., weather, tourism).
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created file responsible for generating the daily digest of news and transcriptions.
    -   **Changes**: Implements the  method, which fetches articles and transcriptions, performs sentiment analysis using , and formats a comprehensive HTML digest.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created file handling social media scraping and integration with local sentiment analysis.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to use  for X/Twitter and  for Facebook (though  faced issues, leading to demo data fallback). It stores scraped posts and applies local sentiment analysis.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created file providing realistic simulated data for social media posts.
    -   **Changes**: Created to serve as a fallback when live social media scraping encounters issues, providing data with specific keywords (e.g., Conseil Départemental de la Guadeloupe, Guy Losbar) for testing and demonstration.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component rendering the UI and handling data fetching.
    -   **Changes**: Initially set up for dashboard and article display. Modified to display statistics and articles from the backend, and is currently being updated to include a search bar in the header, new navigation tabs for Search and Comments, and dedicated content sections for these new functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating new features into the frontend to meet the user's latest requirements. The focus was on enhancing the  file to support a search bar on the main dashboard and introduce a new Comments page.

On the backend, relevant changes were completed:
1.  **Search Keyword Targeting:** Updated internal search keywords to specifically target Conseil Départemental de la Guadeloupe and Guy Losbar within the social media scraping (or demo data generation) logic.
2.  **Demo Data Enhancement:** Added specific demonstration data related to these new entities () to ensure content is available for testing the search and comments features, especially since live social media scraping was problematic.
3.  **Backend Search Endpoint:** A new search endpoint () was created in  to handle search queries from the frontend.

On the frontend (), the following modifications were in progress:
1.  **Core Frontend Structure:** The main  component was being updated to manage new state variables for search queries and potentially comment data.
2.  **Functionality Integration:** New functions like  and  were being added to manage user interactions for the search bar and the comments page.
3.  **UI Components:**
    *   A search bar was added to the header section of the dashboard.
    *   New navigation tabs for Search and Comments were integrated into the existing tab navigation.
    *   Content sections (JSX) for both the SearchPage and CommentsPage were being added into the main content area of the application.

The engineer was in the process of integrating data loading logic for these new sections by modifying the  hook and the  function in  when the trajectory ended. The current state is that backend support for search is ready, and the frontend UI components are being integrated, with data fetching remaining as the immediate next step for frontend completion.
