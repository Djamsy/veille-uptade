<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully completed a series of complex tasks for a media monitoring application. The work began with integrating GPT-4.1-mini for intelligent transcription analysis, replacing a local AI, and implementing detailed status tracking. This involved careful management of OpenAI API keys, handling quota issues, and fixing  path problems and  exceptions during audio processing. A significant challenge was stabilizing long radio captures (20+ minutes), which was resolved by implementing a robust segmented capture and processing method using OpenAI Whisper API. Concurrently, the UI underwent two major redesigns: first to an Apple/Netflix dark theme, and then to a white minimalist theme, coupled with reformatting article and transcription displays for better readability. Throughout the process, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing inconsistencies in transcription statuses and data saving, ensuring a fully functional and polished product.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive media monitoring platform for Guadeloupe, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Its core functionalities include automated daily article listing from local news sites and automated radio transcription using local Whisper. It provides intelligent summarization, 24-hour caching, local sentiment analysis (enhanced for French/Guadeloupean context), and a daily news digest. Social media monitoring (X and Facebook) with local sentiment analysis and a search bar is also integrated. The frontend features a responsive liquid glass design with a desaturated sky blue/sun yellow palette.

During this development trajectory, the following enhancements and fixes were explicitly requested and implemented:
*   **PDF Export:** Ability to download the daily digest as a PDF.
*   **Radio Transcription Debugging & Enhancement:** Resolve persistent 500 errors, empty transcriptions, timeouts, and implement pre-named sections (7H RCI, 7H Guadeloupe Premi√®re).
*   **Intelligent AI Analysis:** Integrate GPT-4.1-mini for interpreting, summarizing, extracting key phrases, identifying subjects, and scoring relevance of raw transcriptions using a specific journalistic prompt.
*   **Transcription Status:** Display in-progress indicators for active transcriptions, including detailed step-by-step progress and a mechanism to clear stale in-progress statuses.
*   **Auto-refresh:** Automatically update the radio transcription interface.
*   **Prioritization:** Elevate radio transcriptions to primary importance over articles in both the dashboard and daily digest, with distinct visual styling.
*   **Long Capture Stability:** Implement a robust solution for stable and reliable long audio captures (e.g., 20 minutes) which were previously failing silently. This involved segmenting the capture process.
*   **UI Redesign (Iterative):** First, a modern Apple/Netflix dark theme with glassmorphism, then a white minimalist design for improved readability.
*   **Article/Transcription Display Format:** Present content as information (title/summary) and explication (detailed text) pairs in the UI.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just finalized a comprehensive set of enhancements, bringing the media monitoring application to a robust and aesthetically polished state. The work culminated in:

1.  **Full OpenAI Integration:** The application now leverages  for intelligent journalistic analysis of radio transcriptions, and the  for fast and efficient speech-to-text conversion. This replaced previous local AI solutions, significantly improving analysis quality and speed. The system adheres to cost control by restricting API calls to scheduled times (7 AM) and requiring an administrative key for on-demand captures.
2.  **Robust Long Capture Solution:** A critical problem of silently failing long audio captures (e.g., 20 minutes) was resolved by implementing a sophisticated segmented capture method. This approach breaks down long recordings into reliable 5-minute segments, processes each, and then concatenates the results, ensuring stability and completion for extended audio content.
3.  **Detailed Status Tracking:** The backend now provides granular, real-time status updates for transcription processes, showing  (with segment progress), , , and  steps. A mechanism was also implemented to automatically clean up any stale in-progress statuses on backend startup and via a dedicated admin endpoint.
4.  **Dynamic UI Updates and Digest Integration:** The frontend now correctly displays the analyzed GPT content for radio transcriptions. The daily digest also properly integrates this AI-generated content, prioritizing radio updates with distinct visual styling, ensuring all content is correctly and promptly reflected across the application.
5.  **Complete UI Redesign:** The application's user interface underwent a significant transformation. Initially, it was revamped to an Apple/Netflix dark theme with elegant glassmorphism and modern typography. Following user feedback, it was further refined into a white minimalist design, focusing on clarity, readability, and a professional, uncluttered aesthetic. This included reformatting the display of articles and transcriptions into clear information / explication pairs.

The application is now fully operational, stable for extended use cases, intelligently analyzed by cutting-edge AI, and boasts a premium, user-friendly interface.
