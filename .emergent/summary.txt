The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic media monitoring MVP into a robust, feature-rich application. Key achievements include the implementation of advanced GPT-based sentiment analysis with asynchronous processing and population reaction prediction, comprehensive production readiness efforts to resolve phantom dependency issues, and a significant UI/UX overhaul. The UI revamp introduced a modern, responsive design with professional elements, article filtering, visual analytics, and complex CSS animations. Most recently, the engineer successfully delivered a narrative-driven website with continuous scroll animations for the dashboard and digest, alongside integrated source logos for articles. The current focus is on debugging a critical issue where articles are failing to load on the frontend despite the backend API functioning correctly, suspected to be a CORS or network configuration problem.

<product_requirements>
The application serves as a comprehensive media monitoring platform for Guadeloupe, built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It aims to deliver daily news articles, automated radio transcriptions via OpenAI Whisper, intelligent summarization, 24-hour caching, and a daily news digest. It also features social media monitoring (X, Facebook) with local sentiment analysis and a search bar, all accessible through a responsive frontend. Key enhancements include AI-driven analysis using GPT-4.1-mini/GPT-4o-mini for transcriptions and sentiment, robust data capture for radio streams and hourly article scraping, and improved social media data extraction. Alerting via Telegram for keyword mentions is also integrated. A significant focus was on transitioning to precise, GPT-based sentiment analysis with asynchronous results and population reaction prediction, alongside deployment readiness by removing heavy local AI dependencies. The UI/UX was revamped for a modern, professional look with new features like article filtering, visual analytics, improved mobile UX, and aesthetic enhancements including source logo integration and stronger sub-colors.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



-   ****: The central FastAPI application, managing API routes and coordinating services. It was crucial for integrating new sentiment and reaction prediction features, adding analytics and filtering endpoints, and enhancing MongoDB connection handling. Recent changes included disabling .
-   ****: Handles GPT-based sentiment analysis. Important for enriching sentiment data with contextual details.
-   ** (NEW)**: Manages asynchronous sentiment analysis tasks, queuing requests and storing results. This is vital for non-blocking sentiment processing.
-   ** (NEW)**: Predicts population reaction, generating detailed forecasts. It adds advanced analytical capabilities to the platform.
-   ****: Python dependencies. Modifications were critical for resolving deployment issues by removing problematic packages (e.g., , , ) and adding necessary ones (, , ).
-   ****: Handles social media data. Changes involved conditionally using  and removing problematic  calls for production stability.
-   ****: Manages radio transcription. Local Whisper model dependencies were removed to streamline deployment.
-   ****: Generates daily digests.  reliance was removed for lighter deployment.
-   ****: Scrapes news articles. Optimized MongoDB connection for Atlas compatibility.

-   ****: The main React component. It underwent extensive changes for UI/UX overhaul, adding states for new features (sentiment, reaction, filtering, analytics), integrating Chart.js, implementing a mobile hamburger menu, and incorporating numerous CSS animations. Most recently, it was heavily modified to create the narrative-driven dashboard and digest, and to integrate and display source logos across all article sections.
-   ****: The main CSS file, refactored for a modern, minimalist, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS principles. It includes styles for glass morphism, professional icons, and custom fonts. Recent additions include extensive CSS for animations (, , , ), specific color variables for sources (KaribInfo), and styles for article logos to support the narrative UI and logo display.
-   ** (NEW)**: A simple HTML page for basic sentiment feature testing.
-   ** (NEW)**: Documents the resolution of production deployment errors.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer has identified several missing critical functionalities for future implementation:
-   Implement a system for **pagination** or infinite scroll for articles.
-   Add a **footer** with essential information.
-   Improve **loading states** with more sophisticated skeletons.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing a Narrative-driven website with scroll animation for the dashboard and digest, and logos next to media names, a new user request following successful resolution of previous tasks.

The engineer initiated this by modifying  and . The dashboard was transformed into a narrative experience with a storytelling title (üèùÔ∏è Veille M√©dia Guadeloupe), engaging subtitles, interactive statistical cards with  and  animations, and progressive  animations. Similarly, the digest section was converted into an immersive narrative interface featuring an animated central title, interactive action buttons with glass-morphism style, and engaging empty states.

Simultaneously, the integration of source logos into article displays, which was previously reported as not working, was successfully rectified. The  utility function in  and new CSS styles in  were refined to ensure logos appear correctly, with intelligent fallbacks (stylized initials like KI for KaribInfo) and custom colors per source. Screenshot verifications confirmed that approximately 150 logo elements were detected and displayed harmoniously across all article sections.

However, immediately after the successful implementation and visual confirmation of the narrative UI and logos, the user reported, article charge pas (articles not loading). The engineer began diagnosing this new issue, first by testing the backend with , which confirmed the  endpoint was working and returning 100 articles. Subsequent frontend debugging via screenshots and console logs revealed Failed to fetch errors for all API requests (stats, search, sources). The current working theory is a CORS configuration problem or a general network connectivity issue between the frontend and backend, despite direct  access to the backend API working.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to further diagnose the Failed to fetch error on the frontend by investigating the backend's CORS configuration.
