<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a media monitoring application for Guadeloupe, focusing on iterative development and adapting to changing requirements. Initial efforts centered on core functionalities like web scraping, speech-to-text, and caching. Key challenges included debugging scrapers for various news sites and resolving MongoDB integration issues. Local sentiment analysis was implemented to avoid external API dependencies. Social media scraping for X (Twitter) and Facebook was integrated, using demo data as a fallback. Recent work involved significant frontend enhancements, including a search bar, a social media comments section, and a complete design overhaul to a liquid glass aesthetic with a specific Caribbean-inspired color palette. The engineer has diligently addressed user feedback, removed demo data, and refactored UI components for responsiveness and improved aesthetics. The immediate focus is now on diagnosing and fixing issues related to radio capture and transcription.

The application is a media monitoring interface for Guadeloupe, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, initially for general online feeds. Its specialized requirements include:

-   **Automated Article Listing:** Daily scraping (10 AM) from , , , and , displaying hyperlinked titles.
-   **Automated Radio Transcription:** Capture and local Whisper transcription of  (7:00-7:20 AM) and  (7:00-7:30 AM).
-   **Intelligent Summarization:** Title + short explanation for each article/transcription.
-   **Intelligent Caching:** 24-hour cache for articles with invalidation on update.
-   **Local Sentiment Analysis:** API-free sentiment scoring for articles, radio transcriptions, and social media posts, enhanced for French/Guadeloupean context.
-   **Daily Digest:** A daily summary of news/transcriptions with sentiment analysis and professional design.
-   **Social Media Monitoring:** Retrieve comments/posts from X and Facebook based on keywords (e.g., Conseil D√©partemental de la Guadeloupe, Guy Losbar, cd971, GUSR, Ary Chalus), with local sentiment analysis and a dedicated search bar.
-   **Frontend Enhancements:** Responsive liquid glass design with desaturated sky blue and sun yellow palette, including a search bar on the dashboard, and a combined R√©seaux Sociaux tab for comments and social media.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of frontend and backend enhancements, focusing on UI/UX and data handling. The primary work was:

1.  **Frontend Design Overhaul**: Implemented a liquid glass (glassmorphism) design across the application, making it responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile. This involved extensive modifications to , , and refactoring components in  to utilize these new styles and ensure visual consistency and responsiveness. This also included changing the color scheme to a desaturated sky blue and sun yellow palette for improved readability and aesthetic appeal, as requested by the user.
2.  **Social Media Functionality Refinement**:
    *   **Demo Data Removal**: Completely removed reliance on demo data for social media posts. This involved modifying  to remove fallback to demo data, creating and executing a cleanup endpoint in  to remove existing demo data from MongoDB, and ultimately deleting the  file.
    *   **Consolidated UI Tabs**: Merged redundant Comments and R√©seaux tabs into a single üí¨ R√©seaux Sociaux tab, enhancing UI clarity in . The Sentiment tab was also removed as sentiment analysis is integrated elsewhere.
    *   **Automatic Social Media Search**: Implemented automatic searching for predefined priority subjects (e.g., cd971, Guy Losbar) on application startup, displaying their post counts in the dashboard. This was configured within 's  hook.
    *   **Specific Social Media Search Bar**: Added a dedicated search bar within the R√©seaux Sociaux page, allowing users to search and trigger scraping for specific keywords. This involved frontend UI changes in  and the creation of a new backend endpoint  in , with enhancements to  to support  queries.

The application's interface is now modern, responsive, and specifically tailored for Guadeloupean media monitoring, and it correctly attempts to scrape real social media data. The previous engineer was evaluating the application's overall state and was then informed by the user that the capture plus transcription functionality (radio stream processing) is not working.
